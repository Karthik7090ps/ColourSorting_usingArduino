# ColourSorting_usingArduino
Color Sorting with Arduino: Employing color sensors and Arduino, this project automates object sorting based on their colors. A servo moves objects past the sensor, which identifies the colors and triggers servo motors to sort them into specific bins accordingly. An exciting integration of hardware and software for efficient color-based sorting
